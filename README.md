# Handle extension
## Introduction
At times you may need an interative response (inside a fully operating browser) for instance sending users to a payment page by sending a post request the payment service.

Inside tools such as postman the response is not interactive and you may not be able to complete the payment process.

## Extention state
The current version of this extention is an MVP which serves my need although if I see that it helps others aswell I would work more on it.

And you are very welcome to make pull request.
